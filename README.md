# Hello 👋, I'm K S Nauman Ahmed
### Learner

Working every day to become a high-performing Software Development Engineer with strong technical depth and hands-on practical experience.

I’m currently focused on MERN Stack Development and DSA to sharpen my problem-solving abilities. I also contribute to open-source projects and build real-world applications that apply the skills I learn—helping me break out of “tutorial hell” and use AI as a tool for guidance rather than something to depend on.

I strongly believe in consistent effort, deep learning, and building practical projects that solve real problems. Every day, I aim to improve a little more and move closer to my long-term goals.

## Projects

### WanderLust

Wanderlust is a marketplace-style listing application where users can explore and filter different places, events, or items. It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), and EJS templates.

The app allows:

Displaying all listings on the home page
Filtering listings by categories like Trending, Popular, New
Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for listings
Adding and managing user reviews on listings
Validating data before saving to the database In short, Wanderlust works like a mini Airbnb/marketplace clone where users can browse listings, check details, and interact with them through reviews.

### HR Measure (Mini Project)

This project is a real-time camera-based heart rate detection application built using Flask, OpenCV, YOLOv8, NumPy, and SciPy. It uses computer vision and signal processing to estimate heart rate (BPM) without any physical sensor.

The app allows:

Detecting a user’s face using a YOLOv8 ONNX face model

Extracting multiple ROIs (forehead + under-eyes) for accurate rPPG signal detection

Measuring heart rate using green-channel intensity, bandpass filtering, and FFT

Streaming real-time video processed through a Flask backend

Displaying BPM with live status messages (Gym Mode or Patient Mode)

Opening a native “Mirror View” window while safely sharing the camera feed

Switching between web-stream view and mirror view using multi-threading

Handling camera failures gracefully with fallback webcam logic

Smoothing and stabilizing BPM using rolling-window averaging

In short, this project works like a real-time biomedical vision system, using only a webcam to detect heart rate with rPPG-based signal extraction and a clean Flask dashboard for monitoring.
